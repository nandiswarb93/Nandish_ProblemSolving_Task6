node /tmp/eKVLl6wAbC.js
enter a number : 150
palindrome primes are : 2 3 5 7 11 101 131 
enter a number : 123456789
min is found first and max is found second
enter a number to find sum of odd and even position diff : 123
the sum od even and odd position is : -2
enter a number : 150
primes in increasing order : 13 17 19 23 29 37 47 59 67 79 89 127 137 139 149 





today problem solving task:

1.Write a program for palindromic primes
i/p :   enter a number : 150
o/p :   palindrome primes are : 2 3 5 7 11 101 131 

2.Finding the minimum and maximum numbers and identifying which is found first and second

i/p: enter a number : 123456789
o/p: min is found first and max is found second

3.write a program for Calculating the difference between the sum of even and odd positions

i/p: enter a number to find sum of odd and even position diff : 123
o/p :the sum of even and odd position is : -2

4.Writing a program for prime numbers in increasing order
i/p: enter a number : 150
o/p : primes in increasing order : 13 17 19 23 29 37 47 59 67 79 89 127 137 139 149
